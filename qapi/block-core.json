# line, the VM will start in the stopped state regardless of whether '-S' is

#
# @base:   #optional The file name of the backing image to write data into.
#                    If not specified, this is the deepest backing image
#
# @top:    #optional The file name of the backing image within the image chain,
#                    which contains the topmost data to be committed down. If
#                    not specified, this is the active layer.
#
# @backing-file:  #optional The backing file string to write into the overlay
#                           image of 'top'.  If 'top' is the active layer,
#                           specifying a backing file string is an error. This

#                           resolved by QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or
#                           HMP commands must use node-names for the image in
#                           question, as filename lookup methods will fail.
#
#                           If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine
#                           the backing file string to use, or error out if
#                           there is no obvious choice. Care should be taken
#                           when specifying the string, to specify a valid
#                           filename or protocol.
#                           (Since 2.1)
#
#                    If top == base, that is an error.
#                    If top == active, the job will not be completed by itself,
#                    user needs to complete the job with the block-job-complete
#                    command after getting the ready event. (Since 2.0)
#
#                    If the base image is smaller than top, then the base image
#                    will be resized to be the same size as top.  If top is
#                    smaller than the base image, the base will not be
#                    truncated.  If you want the base image size to match the

# @block_set_io_throttle:
#
# Change I/O throttle limits for a block drive.
#
# Since QEMU 2.4, each device with I/O limits is member of a throttle
# group.
#
# If two or more devices are members of the same group, the limits
# will apply to the combined I/O of the whole group in a round-robin
# fashion. Therefore, setting new I/O limits to a device will affect
# the whole group.
#
# The name of the group can be specified using the 'group' parameter.
# If the parameter is unset, it is assumed to be the current group of
# that device. If it's not in any group yet, the name of the device
# will be used as the name for its group.
#
# The 'group' parameter can also be used to move a device to a
# different group. In this case the limits specified in the parameters
# will be applied to the new group only.
#
# I/O limits can be disabled by setting all of them to 0. In this case
# the device will be removed from its group and the rest of its
# members will not be affected. The 'group' parameter is ignored.

# @block-stream:
#
# Copy data from a backing file into a block device.
#
# The block streaming operation is performed in the background until the entire
# backing file has been copied.  This command returns immediately once streaming
# has started.  The status of ongoing block streaming operations can be checked
# with query-block-jobs.  The operation can be stopped before it has completed
# using the block-job-cancel command.
#
# If a base file is specified then sectors are not copied from that base file and
# its backing chain.  When streaming completes the image file will have the base
# file as its backing file.  This can be used to stream a subset of the backing
# file chain instead of flattening the entire image.
#
# On successful completion the image file is updated to drop the backing file
# and the BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED event is emitted.
#
# @device: the device name

# @base:   #optional the common backing file name

#
#                          If a pathname string is such that it cannot be
#                          resolved by QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or
#                          HMP commands must use node-names for the image in

#                          is no obvious choice.  Care should be taken when
#                          specifying the string, to specify a valid filename or
