/**
 * QIOTask:
 *
 * The QIOTask object provides a simple mechanism for reporting
 * success / failure of long running background operations.
 *
 * A object on which the operation is to be performed could have
 * a public API which accepts a task callback:
 *
 * <example>
 *   <title>Task callback function signature</title>
 *   <programlisting>
 *  void myobject_operation(QMyObject *obj,
 *                          QIOTaskFunc *func,
 *                          gpointer opaque,
 *                          GDestroyNotify *notify);
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * The 'func' parameter is the callback to be invoked, and 'opaque'
 * is data to pass to it. The optional 'notify' function is used
 * to free 'opaque' when no longer needed.
 *
 * Now, lets say the implementation of this method wants to set
 * a timer to run once a second checking for completion of some
 * activity. It would do something like
 *
 * <example>
 *   <title>Task callback function implementation</title>
 *   <programlisting>
 *    void myobject_operation(QMyObject *obj,
 *                            QIOTaskFunc *func,
 *                            gpointer opaque,
 *                            GDestroyNotify *notify)
 *    {
 *      QIOTask *task;
 *
 *      task = qio_task_new(OBJECT(obj), func, opaque, notify);
 *
 *      g_timeout_add_full(G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT,
 *                         1000,
 *                         myobject_operation_timer,
 *                         task,
 *                         NULL);
 *    }
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * It could equally have setup a watch on a file descriptor or
 * created a background thread, or something else entirely.
 * Notice that the source object is passed to the task, and
 * QIOTask will hold a reference on that. This ensure that
 * the QMyObject instance cannot be garbage collected while
 * the async task is still in progress.
 *
 * In this case, myobject_operation_timer will fire after
 * 3 secs and do
 *
 * <example>
 *   <title>Task timer function</title>
 *   <programlisting>
 *   gboolean myobject_operation_timer(gpointer opaque)
 *   {
 *      QIOTask *task = QIO_TASK(opaque);
 *      Error *err;*
 *
 *      ...check something important...
 *       if (err) {
 *           qio_task_abort(task, err);
 *           error_free(task);
 *           return FALSE;
 *       } else if (...work is completed ...) {
 *           qio_task_complete(task);
 *           return FALSE;
 *       }
 *       ...carry on polling ...
 *       return TRUE;
 *   }
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * Once this function returns false, object_unref will be called
 * automatically on the task causing it to be released and the
 * ref on QMyObject dropped too.
 *
 * The QIOTask module can also be used to perform operations
 * in a background thread context, while still reporting the
 * results in the main event thread. This allows code which
 * cannot easily be rewritten to be asychronous (such as DNS
 * lookups) to be easily run non-blocking. Reporting the
 * results in the main thread context means that the caller
 * typically does not need to be concerned about thread
 * safety wrt the QEMU global mutex.
 *
 * For example, the socket_listen() method will block the caller
 * while DNS lookups take place if given a name, instead of IP
 * address. The C library often do not provide a practical async
 * DNS API, so the to get non-blocking DNS lookups in a portable
 * manner requires use of a thread. So achieve a non-blocking
 * socket listen using QIOTask would require:
 *
 * <example>
 *    static int myobject_listen_worker(QIOTask *task,
 *                                      Error **errp,
 *                                      gpointer opaque)
 *    {
 *       QMyObject obj = QMY_OBJECT(qio_task_get_source(task));
 *       SocketAddress *addr = opaque;
 *
 *       obj->fd = socket_listen(addr, errp);
 *       if (obj->fd < 0) {
 *          return -1;
 *       }
 *       return 0;
 *    }
 *
 *    void myobject_listen_async(QMyObject *obj,
 *                               SocketAddress *addr,
 *                               QIOTaskFunc *func,
 *                               gpointer opaque,
 *                               GDestroyNotify *notify)
 *    {
 *      QIOTask *task;
 *      SocketAddress *addrCopy;
 *
 *      qapi_copy_SocketAddress(&addrCopy, addr);
 *      task = qio_task_new(OBJECT(obj), func, opaque, notify);
 *
 *      qio_task_run_in_thread(task, myobject_listen_worker,
 *                             addrCopy,
 *                             qapi_free_SocketAddress);
 *    }
 * </example>
 *
 * NB, The 'func' callback passed into myobject_listen_async
 * will be invoked from the main event thread, despite the
 * actual operation being performed in a different thread.
