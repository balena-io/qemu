 * QObject Reference Counts Terminology
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 *  - Returning references: A function that returns an object may
 *  return it as either a weak or a strong reference.  If the reference
 *  is strong, you are responsible for calling QDECREF() on the reference
 *  when you are done.
 *
 *  If the reference is weak, the owner of the reference may free it at
 *  any time in the future.  Before storing the reference anywhere, you
 *  should call QINCREF() to make the reference strong.
 *
 *  - Transferring ownership: when you transfer ownership of a reference
 *  by calling a function, you are no longer responsible for calling
 *  QDECREF() when the reference is no longer needed.  In other words,
 *  when the function returns you must behave as if the reference to the
 *  passed object was weak.
